# Realys for Mints Devices

## Central Node V2
Central nodes will have multiple sbc typically requiring either 5 or 12 v inputs intended to be controlled via multiple relays. The relays need to be focused on resistive loads that are work on 5/3.3 microcontrollers with line voltage power handling capabilities of atleast 12v/5v with 5amp inputs. And further they need to be normally closed.

Latichg relays are used to keep current energy without waisting energy.
On solid state relays there are no mechanical parts Typically normally closed and use opto electronics.

Multiple poles means multiple circuits that a relay can control. Eg: a light and a fan. 
Double throw relay gives you alernative open/closed pins. when one is on the other one is off.
