# Realys for Mints Devices

## Central Node V2
Central nodes will have multiple sbc typically requiring either 5 or 12 v inputs intended to be controlled via multiple relays. The relays need to be focused on resistive loads that are work on 5/3.3 microcontrollers with line voltage power handling capabilities of atleast 12v/5v with 5amp inputs. And further they need to be normally closed.




On solid state relays there are no mechanical parts Typically normally closed and use opto electronics.
